# Password Generator

Just a simple web page, which can help you to generate a new password.

Using Web Crypto API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/crypto) under the hood.
No external scripts, no counters and other suspicious stuff - just plain vanilla JS.
The only dependency is Bootstrap CSS from official CDN to make the page a bit prettier.

You can use it directly from GitHub https://zhaparoff.github.io/password-generator or clone/download the page and run it locally.
